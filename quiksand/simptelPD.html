                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>During my internship at Simptel, I worked as a UX designer for "The Future Company" platform. This marketplace enables IT resellers and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to purchase from suppliers and sell services, integrating VoIP technology with a customer management system. My focus was on designing the vendor side of this white-label VoIP management platform.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>My Role and Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>As a UX designer, my primary role was to design the user experience and interface for vendors on this platform. The platform provides vendors with tools to manage customers, sell products, and track finances, facilitating an efficient and integrated experience for IT resellers and MSPs.</p>

                <h3>Design Guidelines and Standards</h3>
                <p>The following design guidelines, set by the company, were crucial in ensuring brand consistency, functionality, and accessibility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Following The Future Company Brand Guide:</strong> Adhered to brand colors, typography, and visual identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile-Responsive Design:</strong> Created a fully responsive design for optimal performance on mobile devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Branding:</strong> Enabled vendors to apply their own branding within the platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible and Modular Design:</strong> Built a modular layout for scalability and adaptability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seamless User Experience:</strong> Focused on a smooth, intuitive experience requiring minimal training.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back-End Neutrality:</strong> Ensured front-end design could integrate easily with any back-end systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility Standards:</strong> Maintained high accessibility standards to align with best practices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology Requirements:</strong> Used Tailwind CSS for styling and Angular as the front-end framework.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it SIMPLE:</strong> Embraced simplicity as a core value, aligning with Simptel’s motto for a user-friendly experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges and Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>Initially, transitioning from game design to UX design was challenging. I took the opportunity to learn quickly, with the company requiring me to complete courses in Figma, mobile design, Tailwind, Angular, and Agile methodologies. Throughout the project, I gained insights into the VoIP business, online payment systems, white-label platforms, and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Working with an international team, especially Simptel’s branch in India, taught me to navigate time zone differences, cultural diversity, and language barriers effectively.</p>

                <h3>Achievements</h3>
                <p>Although the project scope was too large to complete during my internship, I contributed significantly by proposing and implementing the Stripe API, streamlining the payment process. This solution was adopted as a standard and is now used across multiple projects. I received the highest grade possible for my internship due to this achievement.</p>
                <p>Overall, my time at Simptel enhanced my UX/UI skills and provided valuable industry insights.</p>
                
                <h3>Project files</h3>
                <p>At the company's request, I am not permitted to share the final designs or any details related to the integration of VoIP technology with the customer management system. However, I am allowed to showcase other approved parts of the project. and I also redsighn the IAM page on the main website to relfect the new services at the time.</p>
