                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was part of my specialization in game design, assigned by <strong>Games for Health</strong>, a non-profit organization that develops health-enhancing games. Our task was to improve an educational multiplayer game called <strong>"Mikrolokaal"</strong>, created for <strong>Winclove Probiotics</strong>. The game's primary goal is to teach children in grades 7 and 8 about probiotics and healthy living.</p>

                <h3>Challenges and Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>The existing game was static, with minimal interaction, animation, sound, and color. While it was developed in 2D, it was designed to look like a 3D game. Our challenge was to make the game more fun and educational for kids, who typically have short attention spans.</p>
                <p>To address these issues, I had to learn animation techniques, including the <strong>12 Principles of Animation</strong>, and study how to add effects and structure components in Unity. One major obstacle was the lack of comments or documentation in the game's code, requiring us to reverse-engineer and understand it independently.</p>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>Our team employed several creative techniques to enhance the game:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Animation Prototyping:</strong> Used paper prototypes and stop-motion techniques to quickly conceptualize animations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sandbox Environment:</strong> Created a sandbox environment in Unity for rapid iteration and testing of new features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research-Driven Design:</strong> Incorporated insights from color theory and educational design principles to make the game visually engaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Tested the updated game with over 80 kids during the <strong>Night of the Nerds</strong> event, gathering valuable feedback.</li>
                </ul>
              

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The game was traditionally controlled by teachers, who set the difficulty level. During playtesting, we discovered that letting kids take control of the game created a more personal, competitive, and engaging experience. While figuring out the game’s rules, kids unexpectedly started teaching each other about gut health—a testament to the game’s success in fostering peer learning.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Engaging kids in testing and feedback was initially challenging. Even offering candy as an incentive didn’t work. However, through persistent experimentation and iteration, we managed to create a game that not only entertained but also educated in a meaningful way.</p>
